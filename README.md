 # Front End Developer Test
 
 We have a list of ~11k locations which we would like the user to be able to select from. You are required to design and implement a user interface which facilitates this and provides a mechanism to hook into the UI to get the ID of the location.
 
 The UI can be styled however you please (bonus points for using our colour scheme!) and can use any libraries you wish.
 
 We have provided you with a self hosting node service which allows you to search for locations based on a string (see below) but you will also find the complete list in JSON format in the server/data folder.
 
 ## Server
 
 The server folder contains a simple node server which can be started with the shell scripts in the root. You will need Node.js installed (http://www.nodejs.org/) but you the data is also provided if thats an issue.
 
 Once started the server can be used like so:
 
 http://127.0.0.1:8000?q=lon
 
 ## Client
 
 This folder will contain your solution. We have given you a folder structure and jquery to get you started (feel free to change/add/remove stuff).

## Tests

The tests folder contains an empty jasmine test suite. Please use to verify your Javascript code.
